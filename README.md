# EventTime = ZonedDateTime Ã— isTimeExplicit

`EventTime` is a simple, concrete and immutable Java class that is essentially a `java.time.ZonedDateTime` with a flag that indicates if the time part is explicit or not.

If `isTimeExplicit` flag is `false`, i.e. the time part is not given to a constructor, the time part is initialized to "00:00:00".

The advantage of this class is:

- It models both date and date-time, which is often necessary when we think about events in our schedule.
- It is comparable, event though it is essentially either date or date-time.


## Parsing and formatting

`parse` method parses strings of ISO8601-like format, e.g. "2017-05-12", "2017-05-12+09:00", "2017-05-12T19:12:11+09:00". If the time zone is omitted, the system's default time zone is used.

It can also parse time zone IDs, e.g. "2017-05-12T19:12:11[Asia/Tokyo]". (This is not part of ISO8601, though.)

When formatting, it formats the date part only if the `isTimeExplicit` is `false`. If `isTimeExplicit` is `true`, it formats the time part, too.

For detail, see the [test spec](https://github.com/debug-ito/event-time-java/blob/master/src/test/java/com/github/debug_ito/event_time/test/EventTimeParserFormattersTest.java).


## Comparison and equality

`compareTo` method first compares `java.time.Instance`s obtained from the `ZonedDateTime` parts of the two `EventTime` instances. Ties are broken by comparing the `isTimeExplicit` flags (flag `true` is bigger than `false`.)

`equals` method is consistent with `compareTo`. This means there are multiple `EventTime` instances with different time zones that equal to each other.

For detail, see [test case](https://github.com/debug-ito/event-time-java/blob/master/src/test/java/com/github/debug_ito/event_time/test/EventTimeComparisonTest.java).
