# EventTime = ZonedDateTime Ã— isTimeExplicit

**This project is now under development.**

`EventTime` is a simple, concrete and immutable Java class that is essentially a `java.time.ZonedDateTime` with a flag that indicates if the time part is explicit or not.

If `isTimeExplicit` flag is `false`, i.e. the time part is not given to a constructor, the time part is initialized to "00:00:00".

## Parsing and formatting

TBW. It supports ISO8601, with some extension.

## Comparison and equality

`compareTo` method first compares `java.time.Instance`s obtained from the `ZonedDateTime` parts of the two `EventTime` instances. Ties are broken by comparing the `isTimeExplicit` flags (flag `true` is bigger than `false`.)

`equals` method is consistent with `compareTo`. This means there are multiple `EventTime` instances with different time zones that equal to each other.
